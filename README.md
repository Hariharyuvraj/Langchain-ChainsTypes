# LangChain Chain Types - Practice

This repository contains my practice code and experiments with **different chain types in LangChain**.  
The goal is to understand how to build, combine, and execute chains for various LLM applications.

##  Topics Covered
The practice covers the following chain types in LangChain:

1. **LLMChain** – Using a prompt template with a language model.
2. **SequentialChain** – Passing output of one chain as input to another.
3. **parallelchain
